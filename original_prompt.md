Speedy Vibe Coding Prompt: End-of-Semester Sentiment and Skills Showcase

You’re preparing a quick, interactive wrap-up for your Introduction to Coding in the Humanities class. Let’s keep it simple and fast: use Reveal.js to build your slide deck so you can have a familiar, easy-to-navigate presentation framework. For the sentiment analysis, plug in a lightweight JavaScript sentiment library, like Sentiment.js, to quickly sort those floating thought bubbles by positivity or negativity.

In “presentation mode,” let those bubbles appear in real time, showing how your students’ confidence and sentiments have evolved. Also, use a simple quiz slide to test their basic Python and NLP skills and aggregate those results in a neat table.

By including these tools up front, you’ll speed up your prototyping process and have a working prototype in no time. Keep it quick, keep it fun, and enjoy the coding!
